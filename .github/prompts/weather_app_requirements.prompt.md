# Requirements for a Weather App

Create a React Application that fetches and displays weather data from a public API. The app should have the following features:

1. **User Interface**:
   - A clean and user-friendly interface.
   - A search bar for users to input a city name.
   - A display area for the weather information.
2. **Weather Data**:
   - Fetch weather data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI).
   - Display the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid city names or network issues.
   - Display appropriate error messages to the user.
4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure the app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
5. **Styling**:
   - Use CSS or a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind) for styling.
   - Ensure the app is visually appealing and easy to navigate.

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **React**: Use React for building the user interface.
2. **State Management**: Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management.
3. **API Integration**: Use Fetch API or Axios for making API calls.
4. **Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables for security.
5. **Version Control**: Use Git for version control and host the code on GitHub.
6. **Typescript**: Use TypeScript for type safety and better development experience.
7. **Vite**: Use Vite as the build tool for faster development and hot module replacement.
8. **Yarn**: Use Yarn as the package manager for managing dependencies. Use node_modules and yarn.lock for dependency management.
