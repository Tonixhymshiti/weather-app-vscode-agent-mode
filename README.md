# Weather App built with VS Code agent mode

This app has been built with the help of the new Prompt feature of VS Code. You can find the prompt under `.github/prompts` directory.

The code is generated by the Agent Mode in VS Code, using GPT-4.1.

## Main features

- Search for current weather data by entering a city name
- View detailed weather information including temperature, humidity, and conditions
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

Fore additional documentation on the prompt feature, checkout VS Code's official documentation: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_prompt-files-experimental

## OpenWeatherMap API Key

You'll need an API Key for being able to fetch weather data. See instructions here: [Instructions](https://openweathermap.org/appid).

After generating your API key, add it to a `.env` file in the project root. Refer to the `.env.sample` file for the required format and variable names.

## Running the app

Simply execute `yarn dev` and you are good to go!
